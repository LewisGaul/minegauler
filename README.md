## Try it out!

### Download the executable

The application has been packaged with PyInstaller so that it can be played without setting up Python.

Download links available here:
 - [Windows (amd64)](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler/releases/latest/download/minegauler-v4.1.2-windows-amd64.zip)
 - [Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler/releases/latest/download/minegauler-v4.1.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)
 - [MacOS (x86_64)](https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler/releases/latest/download/minegauler-v4.1.2-macos-x86_64.tar.gz)


### Install from PyPI

The Python package is also available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/minegauler/.

 1. Python 3.7+ required
 2. Install with `pip install minegauler`
 3. Run with `python -m minegauler`

See note on system dependencies below, or [get in touch](#Contact) if you have any issues.


### Clone the repo

You will need Python 3.7+ to run the code (see note below about known system dependencies).

 1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/LewisGaul/minegauler`
 2. Consider setting up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
 3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 4. Run with `python -m minegauler`


#### System dependencies

Annoyingly, the latest version of PyQt5 introduced a new system dependency on Linux, and this new version is required to run on Python3.8+.

If running with `python -m minegauler` fails with `Aborted (core dumped)` on Linux, try installing the dependency with:  
`sudo apt install libxkbcommon-x11-0`


## What's new/upcoming?

Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see a log of changes that have been made, as well as some of the upcoming features and planned fixes.

## Development guide

Install the developer requirements (e.g. pytest + plugins) with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

Run the tests with the command: `python -m pytest`.

Get coverage information using the pytest-cov plugin: `python -m pytest --cov [--cov-report html]`.
